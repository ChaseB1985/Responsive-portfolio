      <p>My name is Chase Barrier. I have lived in the Dallas area for 33 years. I am married to my beautiful wife Heather and we have a one year old daughter.</p>

      <p>I have some college experience and plan on going back to finish when the time is right. </p>

      <p>Currently I work at State Farm where I just celebrated my 5 year anniversary with the company. I was hand picked because of superb metrics to join a new department. </p>
